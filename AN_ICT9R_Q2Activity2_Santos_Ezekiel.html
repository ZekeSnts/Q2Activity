	<h1>His Journey's Just Begun</h1>
	<h3>by Ellen Brenneman</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Don’t think of him as gone away<br>
	his journey’s just begun,<br>
	life holds so many facets<br>
	this earth is only one.<br>
	</p>

	<p>Just think of him as resting<br>
	from the sorrows and the tears<br>
	in a place of warmth and comfort<br>
	where there are no days and years.</p>

	<p>Think how he must be wishing<br>
	that we could know today<br>
	how nothing but our sadness<br>
	can really pass away.</p>

	<p class="Para4">And think of him as living<br>
	in the hearts of those he touched…<br>
	for nothing loved is ever lost<br>
	and he was loved so much.</p>
